# ElementalDefenseVR
A prototype of a stationary VR shooter game where you have to think before you shoot.


Although this repository was just posted, the prototype was made way back in April 2021 as a part of VR course. I made a mistake of deleting the original project files without making a backup and this is what is left from the prototype. The prototype was recovered from Google Classroom so hopefully it is still functional.


The concept of the game is "Same element does nothing while opposite kills". When you are using a fire(red) gun, you can only kill ice(blue) enemies and vice versa. For the shield, you need to equip with the same element to block enemies' bullets otherwise their bullets go through your shield. You stay stationary and try to survive and kill as many enemies as possible.


### Alternatively.. these are still available to be watched and downloaded.
